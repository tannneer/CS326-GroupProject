## Priorites page levels of priority

Similar to the reminders applications, users can list out what is a priority to get done. They will be able to write done what is a priority and when it needs to get done, and after writing you will pick the level of priority. There will be “!” to determine the level of priority so !!! top priority, !! mid-level priority, and ! low- level priority. This should also be able to show in the calender with the priority name and level.

## Analysis shows a pie chart and completion bar

The analysis collects weekly data of how much tasks, goals, and priorities that have been completed. It will show a completion bar when all work is completed by the end of the week. The pie chart just shows an analysis of what percentage of work the user focused on during the week based on labels {homework, personal work, priorities, etc}.

Point Value: Large 

Reason: The feature involves data collection and visualization, requiring coding for both the pie chart and the completion bar. It also includes real-time updates and integration of user inputs, which adds complexity.

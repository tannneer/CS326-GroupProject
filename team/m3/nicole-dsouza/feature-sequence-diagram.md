Chosen Feature: Contentment Progress Bar

Note: This feature was done in collaboration with Paola Aoun.

Diagram:
```mermaid
flowchart TD;
    A[Unsatisfied with progress?] --> B[User drags the indicator on the bar to the left end to their desire];
    C[Happy with progress?] --> D[User drags the indicator on the bar to the right end to their desire];
    B --> E[User's contentment is displayed on a scale of 0-100%]
    D --> E[User's contentment is displayed on a scale of 0-100%]
```

Description:
This flowchart outlines a user's ability to mark their contentment with a progress bar. Specifically, if a user is satisfied with their current progress on their tasks, they can drag the indicator to the right, depending on how happy they are. Otherwise, they can drag the indicator to the left if they are not satisfied. A user does not have to update this feature at certain pointsâ€”it is simply there to help them track how content they are with what they have done.

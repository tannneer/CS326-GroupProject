-  **Task**: Created priorites page
-  **Details**: I designed and developed the priorities page to help users efficiently manage their tasks. This included creating the "Create Priority" page, where users can add tasks, assign priority levels (!!! for high, !! for medium, and ! for low), and set due dates. I integrated a calendar view that dynamically displays tasks by due dates and priority levels, ensuring clear visualization of upcoming deadlines. Additionally, I implemented functionality for users to edit, update, and delete tasks directly from the priorities page or calendar view. I focused on enhancing the user experience by testing and refining the interface for usability and accessibility, incorporating feedback to optimize the layout for intuitive task management.

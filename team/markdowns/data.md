The data.md file is where your team will describe the types of data your web application will handle. This document should provide a high-level overview of the data that is critical to your application's functionality, including any user data, input data, or system-generated data. The focus should be on describing what data your application will use and how it will be structured, but you do not need to describe the specific storage methods or databases at this stage.

Your description should include:

Data Types: List and describe each type of data that your application will use. For example, user profiles, expenses, transactions, or settings. For each data type, explain what kind of information is captured.

Attributes: For each data type, list the key attributes or fields that will be stored. For example, for a "User Profile" data type, relevant attributes might include name, email, and user preferences. Include any relevant metadata, such as timestamps or IDs.

Relationships Between Data: If applicable, explain how different types of data are related to each other. For example, a user profile might be related to multiple expense entries, or a savings goal might be related to a user’s transactions. This will help in understanding how your application organizes and uses data.

Data Sources: Describe where the data comes from. Is it user-input data, data from third-party APIs, or system-generated data? This is important for understanding the flow of data into your application.

This file serves as a foundational guide to your application’s data, ensuring that your team understands what information will be handled and how it is organized. Although you don’t need to discuss specific storage methods at this point, this document will help guide decisions related to data management as the project progresses.

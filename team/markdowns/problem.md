# Problem Statement 


## Problem Description 

Managing time well remains one of the most difficult parts of adult life as many of us juggle school, work, activities, familial responsibilities and a social life. This is despite the many tools at our disposal from to do lists to calendar apps. What these solutions miss though are that they often divorce our goals from the time needed to achieve them. For example, most calendar apps are good for defining a schedule or routine, but do not demand concrete results in the time set aside, while on the other hand, to-do lists fall prey to focusing too much on short term results at the expense of longer term goals and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The result is that we are either over-worked or unsatisfied with our progress towards our goals, coupled with feeling like there is no good separation between work and rest as time flies with little to show for it.

## Proposed Solution 

Time Bank aims to bridge the gap between to-do list and calendar apps by making our goals time bound, concrete and realistically achievable. It will work backwards from your main goals by breaking them down into sub tasks and assigning time to achieve each of them over days, weeks and months. These broken down tasks are then put into a schedule of your own making so that we can track what has been achieved over time. We can also visualize our time commitments to see how far along we are towards achieving our goals and whether we are happy with how we are spending our time. 

The main features of this web application are: 

- **Time bank**: Take time from your account - by adding upcoming deadlines or carving out time for things you value 
-**Invest time into your goals**: - by setting aside time to achieve them 
-**Visualize Time committed to goals**: - demonstrating how youâ€™ve spent your time (what goals you have achieve vs not and how far along you are) 
-**Time wastage**: - how it takes away from other activities
-**Dynamic task based calendar**: 
A goals based calendar - that shows what tasks you need to complete in an allotted time 

## Why this matters

Today time is a commodity which is under constant threat by distractions and an overwhelming amount of choices. By treating time as a finite and concrete resource that can be invested and spent we can be more mindful of how we use it. We are empowered to make choices with our time to achieve our goals and spend it on what matters most in life. By doing this we avoid feeling like time is just flying by without spending it on things we value and can enjoy life healthily and care-free knowing that there is not a better way we could be doing things as we have carefully planned our life by all the things we prioritize and attributed the time we see fit to achieve them be it - work, a side-hustle or project or family, friends and hobbies.

- **Task:** Worked independently to design and implement the timer section on the calendar page.  
- **Description:**  
Implemented a timer on the left side of the calendar page, allowing users to time their work on tasks. The timer includes:  
- **Start Button:** Begins the timer.  
- **Stop Button:** Pauses the timer.  
- **Reset Button:** Resets the timer to `00:00`.  

The timer is visually styled with a clean UI and is functionally integrated to track elapsed time in seconds and minutes.
